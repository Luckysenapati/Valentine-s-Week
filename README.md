💘 Valentine’s Week Interactive Web Experience
A beautiful, responsive single-page Valentine’s Week website built with HTML5, CSS (Glassmorphism), Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
The site dynamically changes its theme, emojis, background, GIFs, and messages based on the Valentine’s Week date (Feb 7–14).
It features animated backgrounds, floating emojis, a playful “Will you be my Valentine?” proposal with a runaway No button, music toggle, and a delightful confetti celebration on Yes.
Designed for smooth UX, mobile responsiveness, and a joyful romantic experience. 💖✨
